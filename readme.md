# Warehouse Drone Routing with Z3

This Python code implements a warehouse routing optimization problem using the Z3 theorem prover. The goal is to find an optimal path for a drone to visit all the locations (represented as coordinates) within a warehouse while considering battery constraints.

## Dependencies

- Python
- Z3 theorem prover
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Description

The code defines a warehouse environment with a set of coordinates and a starting position for the drone. It then sets up a Z3 optimization problem to find the optimal path for the drone to visit all locations within a given number of timesteps, subject to battery constraints.

The optimization problem is formulated using Z3's constraint programming interface. The variables include the drone's position (`PGx`, `PGy`) and battery level (`Bat`) at each timestep. Constraints are added to ensure valid movement, battery consumption, and visitation of all locations.

After setting up the problem, the code uses Z3's solver to find a solution (if one exists) and prints the result. If a solution is found, the drone's path and battery levels can be extracted from the model.

## Usage

1. Install the required dependencies.
2. Run the Python script.
3. The code will print the result of the Z3 solver (`sat` if a solution is found, `unsat` otherwise).
4. If a solution is found, the drone's path and battery levels can be extracted from the model (`a` in the code).

## Customization

You can modify the code to change the warehouse layout, battery capacity, or other parameters by adjusting the respective variables and constraints. Additionally, you can extend the code to visualize the drone's path or incorporate additional constraints or objectives.

## Note

This code is an example implementation and may require further optimization or modifications to handle larger-scale problems or more complex scenarios.
